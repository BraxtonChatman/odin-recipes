    <h1>Recipes</h1>
    <p>
        Here you will find a few of my favorite recipes. I link to the websites
        that give the recipes, I give a brief description, and I include a 
        relevant image for each recipe.

    <h3>Blackberry Clafoutis</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://lifecurrentsblog.com/blackberry-clafoutis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Clafoutis</a> is a French dessert custard dish. I first made this dish when I
        had picked a lot of blackberries one season. If, like me, you enjoy a custard-type<br>
        dish, then you should enjoy this dish. I would also liken it somewhat to the texture
        of a thin pancake.

    <h3>Taco Seasoning</h3>
    <p>
        If you had a childhood anything like the one I had, then you've absolutely had plenty of ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning. Whether it was for tacos,<br>
        burritos, or some other creative invention, you've had it. The good news I bring is that you don't have to buy those premade packets. With just a few key<br>
        ingredients (most of which you should already have), you can have yourself a homemade taco seasoning that takes exactly the same as store bought. Check it out:
