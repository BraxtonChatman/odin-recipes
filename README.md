# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project’s **Foundations: HTML** curriculum.

The website consists of a main index page with links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a short description, an ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

## Purpose

This project reinforces fundamental HTML skills, including:

- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML elements
- Linking between pages using relative paths
- Creating lists, headings, and paragraphs
- Organizing a multi-page website

At this stage, no CSS has been applied; the focus is on practicing clean and correct HTML. Styling will be added later in the curriculum.

## Skills Demonstrated

✅ Creating and structuring HTML documents  
✅ Linking multiple pages together  
✅ Using lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) and images (`<img>`) in web pages  
✅ Managing a project with Git and GitHub  

## Project Status

✅ Basic HTML structure complete  
⬜ CSS styling to be added in a future lesson
